### Sectoral Contribution to the Economy

The Indian economy is broadly divided into three sectors, with the services sector being the dominant contributor to the nation's Gross Value Added (GVA).

* **Services Sector:** This is the largest sector, accounting for approximately **53-55%** of India's GVA. It includes a wide range of industries such as IT and software services, financial services, real estate, trade, hotels, transport, and communication. The services sector remains a key driver of economic growth and a major recipient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).

* **Industry Sector:** Contributing around **28-31%** to the GVA, this sector is a vital component of the economy. It is composed of manufacturing, construction, mining, and utilities like electricity and gas. The manufacturing sub-sector, in particular, has shown strong growth, bolstered by government initiatives.

* **Agriculture and Allied Sector:** This primary sector contributes approximately **16-18%** to the GVA. While its share in the national income has decreased over time, it remains crucial as it provides employment to a significant portion of the Indian population (around 53%).

### Additional Highlights

* **Exports:** Total exports reached a record **$824.9 billion** in the financial year 2024-25, driven by strong performance in engineering goods, electronics, and pharmaceuticals. Services exports have more than doubled over the last decade.
* **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** Cumulative FDI inflows have crossed the **$1.05 trillion** mark, indicating strong global confidence in the Indian economy. The services sector is the largest recipient of FDI equity inflows.
* **Capital Markets:** There is a sharp rise in retail investor participation, with the number of investors growing from 4.9 crore in 2019 to 13.2 crore by the end of 2024, reflecting deepening capital markets.
